Welcome to Lightning In A Cone!

This organization is probably a bit different than what you may be accustomed, 
but everyone is trying to do their own thing these days and there really is no longer
a set 'way-to-do-things'.  

This repo serves as an introduction to Lightning In A Cone.  

What is 'Lightning In A Cone'?

Excellent question.  At the moment, it's nothing.  Nothing at all except a bunch of ideas in limbo.

The intention is to build Lightning In A Cone into a hub for knowledge-based activities and learning.  

The intention is and always will be to jump in where you think you feel comfortable, and then 
backtrack when you feel you may need more understanding, or jump ahead when you feel you need more challenge.

As with everything, this will take time.

The organization is very much a part of me and my personal interests.  There may be certain things that 
do not make sense to you, but I can assure you that they exist for a reason.

As a prime example: I will never hire anyone who cannot solve a Rubik's cube.  If you don't know how 
to solve a cube, then please go get one and search the internet for instructions on how to solve it.

Then practice.  It's may take some time, but you'll begin to understand once you can solve a cube 
in under 10 minutes...then 5 minutes...then 2 minutes...but you'll never get close if you cannot solve the cube at all.

So...your challenge is to:
1. Grab a cube and practice
2. Make a video showing yourself solving the cube.  Please introduce yourself and maybe tell us a few interests.  
3. Post the video to your online profile of choice (YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, etc...)
4. Create a branch with your username and make a readme like this one.
5. Post the link to your video so we can see you solve the cube.

After the cube thing is done, you may be elegible for other project opportunities.  

Project opportunities come in two basic flavors: Public and Private.

Public projects involve the public repositories and are largely oriented towards general education 
and playground-style learning.  These repos involve partial or completed educational tasks and studies, as well as notes for 
many different courses and methodologies.  The overall intention is to create an encyclopedic reference, of sorts.

Private projects are more geared towards generating IP and business revenue.  These might be specific game concepts or other 
ideas that are on the table for those who may be interested.  These repositories are more for the purpose of building
long term, sustainable business. 

Anyway, I have a lot of work to do.  Branch this repo and show me that cube video!  I will make an example branch 
with my username to demonstrate.
